# hell Context

hell is a compact Angular component system for dense business applications. It favors primitives, composites, and heavier features that keep consumer markup flexible while concentrating behavior, accessibility, styling, and documentation contracts inside the library.

## Domain Terms

**Style Opt-Out**
The shared contract that lets consumers keep a hell module's behavior and accessibility while removing its default host styling with `unstyled`.

**Floating Interaction**
Any interaction involving content rendered outside, beside, or above its logical host: menus, popovers, tooltips, dialogs, flyouts, selects, comboboxes, and omnibar child overlays.

**Floating Scope**
The set of DOM targets that count as "inside" one floating interaction, even when a floating surface is rendered outside the logical host.

**Dialog Scope**
The content region that a scoped dialog should cover while leaving surrounding app shell chrome interactive.

**Resize Behavior**
The pointer, keyboard, sizing, and minimum-size rules shared by resizable panes and table column resizing, independent of the layout adapter that renders it.

**PDF Runtime**
The pdf.js lifecycle behind the PDF viewer: bootstrapping, worker ownership, document loading, viewer events, find state, thumbnails, printing, and cleanup.

**Docs Catalog**
The docs app source of truth for pages, navigation, routes, icons, sections, and searchable entries.

**Docs Example**
A live Angular example plus its raw source code, preview options, and search metadata.

**Package Entry Point**
A public import path exposed by the `hell` package, including the root entry point and secondary entry points such as primitives, composites, core, and feature-specific imports.

**Light Root Entry Point**
The Package Entry Point policy where the root `hell` import stays convenient for core, primitives, and composites, while heavier features stay behind feature-specific Package Entry Points.

**Floating Dismissal**
The listener-driven part of a Floating Interaction that decides when outside pointer, outside focus, or Escape should close a surface, while preserving consumer control over those rules.

**Resize Transaction**
The layout-agnostic pointer or keyboard resize operation that tracks start sizes, deltas, minimums, commits, and cancellation separately from the Adapter that reads or writes DOM layout.

**PDF Adapter**
A swappable Adapter behind the PDF Runtime seam for browser, pdf.js, worker, print, and download concerns that may change during pdf.js upgrades.
